Very simple and unpolished implementation of genetic algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem for fun.
Represents each population member as N-length array of int 1-N.\n
Uses simple "number of conflicts" heuristic to assess fitness.\n
Very interesting to see how easily this can solve for N up to 10.
At 11, it starts to struggle. Experimenting with population sizes could probably help.
